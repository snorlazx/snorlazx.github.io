		<h1>Page Margins</h1>
		<h2>One inch is not enough</h2>
		<p class="dropcap1"><span>P</span>age margins set the default territory your text occupies on the page. Because they determine the maximum width of the text block, page margins have the greatest effect on line length. (Point size also affects line length, though more finely.) As page margins increase, line length decreases, and vice versa.</p>
				<h5>Note: A gutter margin is extra space on the inner edge of a page, used to account for a binding. In a duplex (two-sided) document, the gutter margin will automatically alternate sides.</h5>

	<h4>In Print</h4>
	<p>Most word processors default to page margins of one inch. On standard 8.5″ × 11″ paper, that produces a line length of 6.5″. That was fine for the monospaced fonts of the typewriter era, which used a lot of horizontal space. But for proportional fonts, they’re too small.</p>
